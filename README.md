Spark RDD Exploration and Sales Data Analysis
This repository contains an exploration of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) in Apache Spark and a PySpark program that performs data cleaning and analysis on a sales dataset.

Task 1: Explore RDD in Spark
In this task, we delve into the concept of RDDs in Apache Spark. RDDs are the fundamental data structures in Spark and provide a fault-tolerant, immutable, and partitioned collection of records that can be operated on in parallel across multiple nodes in a cluster.

We explore the following key aspects of RDDs:

Resilience: RDDs are resilient to node failures and can automatically recreate partitions on different nodes when failures occur.
Distribution: RDDs are distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster, enabling parallel processing and scalability.
Immutability: RDDs are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created. Transformations on RDDs create new RDDs, preserving the original RDD.
Partitioning: RDDs are partitioned across multiple nodes in the cluster, allowing for parallelism and efficient data distribution.
Lazy Evaluation: RDDs follow a lazy evaluation model, where transformations are not executed until an action is called to materialize the results.
Transformations and Actions: RDDs support various transformations (e.g., map, filter, flatMap) and actions (e.g., count, collect, reduce) for data manipulation and computation.
We also discuss the benefits of using PySpark, which provides a Python API for interacting with Spark and enables Python programmers to leverage Spark's functionalities within their Python code.

Task 2: Sales Data Analysis with PySpark
In this task, we develop a PySpark program that reads a CSV file containing sales data, performs data cleaning, and calculates the total sales amount for each product. The program follows these steps:

Read the sales data from a CSV file using PySpark.
Handle missing values and remove duplicate records to ensure data quality.
Calculate the total sales amount for each product using transformations and actions in PySpark.
Output the results to a new CSV file.
The program demonstrates the use of PySpark's DataFrame API for data manipulation and aggregation. It showcases the power of Spark in processing large datasets efficiently and performing data analysis tasks.

Dataset
The sales dataset used in this project is provided in the repository. It contains information about sales transactions, including product details, quantities, and prices.

Requirements
To run the PySpark program, you need to have the following installed:

Python (version 3.x)
Apache Spark (version 3.x)
PySpark library
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
Place the sales dataset CSV file in the same directory as the PySpark program.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the PySpark program using the command: python sales_analysis.py.
The program will read the sales dataset, perform data cleaning, calculate the total sales amount for each product, and output the results to a new CSV file.
Conclusion
This project provides an overview of RDDs in Apache Spark and demonstrates their usage through a PySpark program that analyzes sales data. By leveraging the power of Spark and PySpark, we can efficiently process large datasets, perform data cleaning, and derive valuable insights from the data.
